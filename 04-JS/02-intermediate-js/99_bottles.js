/*This is one of the ways you could have solved the challenge using a while loop. There are many others, as long as you achieve the desired outcome -printing the lyrics to the 99 bottles of beer song- then you are successful! If you've come up with a fancy solution or something different, be sure to share it in the Q&A section for other students to learn from!

    if (numberOfBottles === 1) {
        bottleWord = "bottles";

/*If you want to challenge yourself further, try changing the code to make the english more grammatically correct. So the final output should say "1 bottle of beer on the wall" when numberOfBottles is equal to 1 rather than "1 bottles of beer on the wall" and when numberOfBottles is equal to 0, you can make the output "No more bottles of beer on the wall" instead of 0 bottles of beer on the wall".*/
